# Embedded Learning Library (ELL)

## Overview

ELL is an early preview of our work on building and deploying machine-learned pipelines onto resource-constrained embedded platforms. 
This project is a work in progress and we expect it to change rapidly. At this early stage, we recommend not to take any dependencies on our work.
