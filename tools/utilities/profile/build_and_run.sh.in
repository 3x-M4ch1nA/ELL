# To install perf:
#
# uname -a  # get Linux version
#
# sudo apt-get install linux-perf-4.9  # (Use this for Raspbian Jesse)
#   --or--
# sudo apt-get install linux-tools-3.6  # for older versions of Linux (?)

# perf events to try looking at:
#
#   cpu-time
#   instructions
#   cpu-cycles
#   cache-references
#   cache-misses
#   LLC-loads
#   LLC-load-misses
#   dTLB-load-misses
#   branches
#   branch-misses
#
# other:
#   faults
#   L1-dcache-load-misses
#   context-switches (cs)
#   cpu-migrations

# Note: On the ARM, we can only collect samples from 4 counters at a time
# Note: add '-s' option to perf record and '-T' option to perf report to get per-thread info
