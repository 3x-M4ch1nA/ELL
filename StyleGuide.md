Embedded Machine Learning Library (EMLL) style guide
====================================================

This is the C++ coding style guide for the EMLL project.

File names and extensions
-------------------------
Header files use the extension ".h". Source code files use the extension ".cpp" if they are compiled into a .lib or .exe, and ".tcc" if they contain templated source code.
Each file should typically contain a single class and its name should match the class name.

Projects
--------
A project is a set of source files that compile into a single executable or library, or that implement a single template library.

Naming:  
Projects have camelCase names, preferrably single word, such as "linear", "layers", "utilities", "compile".

Directory, namespace, output naming:  
All of the source code in a project should be defined in a namespace that shares the project name. All of the source files associated with a project should be contained in a directory that shares the project name. The executable or library generated by a project should share the project name. 

Project directory structure:  
Each project is contained in a directory. The directory contains a CMakeLists.txt file. The directory typically contains the following subdirectories:

* "include", for h files
* "src" for cpp files (unless the project defines a template library without cpp files)
* "tcc" for tcc files (these define implementaitons of template classes)
* "test" for source files that define unit tests, invoked via ctest
* "doc" for documentation that does not fit in the source files themselves. For example, complex mathy algorithms may require detailed documentation in a latex file, which would live in the doc directory

Additionally, the directory can contain a README.md file.  

Naming
------
All names should be as descriptive as possible. Prefer whole words to abbreviations, especially if those abbreviations could be ambiguous. Example: prefer `GetFunctionDefinition` to `GetFuncDef`

Classes, structs, and enum classes:
use PascalCase, e.g., `class MyClass {};`

Functions, member and non-member:  
use PascalCase, e.g., `int GetValue() const { return _value; }`  

When possible, function names should be imperative mood verbs, e.g., `GetValue()` and `Permute()`. Specifically, accessor member functions should start with `Get`, e.g., `GetOutputVector()`. 
A few exceptions are:

* a member functions that returns the size of an object, which can simply be `Size()`
* type conversion functions, which can start with `To`, e.g., `ToString()`
* functions that return the number of elements in a collection, which can start with `Num`, e.g. `NumVariables()`

Member variables:
Use `_` (underscore) followed by camelCase, e.g., `_myMemberVariable`

Template typenames: 
Use PascalCase and add the suffix "Type", e.g., `template <typename SparseVectorType>`

File structure
--------------
All source code files should start with a header that specifies project name, file name, and author list (see example below)

.h files should indicate `#pragma once` immediately after the header

Next, indicate all `#include` statements. First, include files from the local project. Second, include files from other projects, grouping by project and adding the project name as a comment. Finally, include standard libraries.
